## Instructions

Install the plugin as usual. 

In Appearance > Widgets, drag a new instance of the widget into a widget area. 

You can drag one or more widgets into the area, but it's best not to use any other widgets. 

Set a title, choose an icon from Font Awesome (no need for the 'icon-' prefix) and fill the text box. 

Choose the widths at which to display the widget. The total for each widget's Large, Medium, Small and Extra Small in the area should be exactly 12.
